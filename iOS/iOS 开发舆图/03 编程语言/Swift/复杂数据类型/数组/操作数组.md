Array for数组循环

```objectivec
for ship in ships {
    print("\(ship.value) is from \(ship.key)")
}

//反数组
for ship in ships.reversed() {
    print("\(ship.value) is from \(ship.key)")
}

for (index, ship) in ships.enumerated() {
    print("\(index + 1). \(ship.value) is from \(ship.key)")
}

// this will count down from 3 to 1
for (index, ship) in ships.enumerated().reversed() {
    print("\(index + 1). \(ship.value) is from \(ship.key)")
}

// this will count up from 1 to 3
for (index, ship) in ships.reversed().enumerated() {
    print("\(index + 1). \(ship.value) is from \(ship.key)")
}

ships.forEach {
    print("\($0.value) is from \($0.key)")
}

for i in 0 ..< movies.count {
    print("Episode \(i + 1): \(movies[i])")
}
```
